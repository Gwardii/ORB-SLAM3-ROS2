# Steps to use this wrapper

## 1. Clone this repository

1. ```git clone https://github.com/Gwardii/ORB-SLAM3-ROS2```
2. ```cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2```
3. ```git submodule update --init --recursive --remote```

## 2. Install Docker on your system

```bash
cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2
sudo chmod +x container_root/shell_scripts/docker_install.sh
./container_root/shell_scripts/docker_install.sh
```

## 3. Build the image with ORB_SLAM3

1. Build the image: `sudo docker build -t orb-slam3-humble:22.04 .`
2. Add `xhost +` to your `.bashrc` to support correct x11-forwarding using `echo "xhost +" >> ~/.bashrc`
3. `source ~/.bashrc`
4. You can see the built images on your machine by running `sudo docker images`.

## 4. Running the container

1. `cd ORB-SLAM3-ROS2` (ignore if you are already in the folder)
2. `sudo docker compose run orb_slam3_22_humble`
3. This should take you inside the container. Once you are inside, run the command `xeyes` and a pair of eyes should pop-up. If they do, x11 forwarding has correctly been setup on your computer.

## 5. Building the ORB-SLAM3 Wrapper

Launch the container using steps in (4).

```bash
cd /root/colcon_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

## Launching ORB-SLAM3

Launch the container using steps in (4).
If you are inside the container, run the following:

1. `ros2 launch orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper unirobot.launch.py`
2. You can adjust the initial co-ordinates of the robot along with its namespace in the `unirobot.launch.py` file.

## Important notes

ORB-SLAM3 is launched from `orb_slam3_docker_20_humble/orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/launch/rgbd.launch.py` which inturn is launched from `orb_slam3_docker_20_humble/orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/launch/unirobot.launch.py`

Currently the `rgbd.launch.py` launch file defaults to `orb_slam3_ros2_wrapper/params/scout_v2_rgbd.yaml`. You can modify this with your own parameter file in case you wish to use your own camera.

The very initial versions of this code were derived from [thien94/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper](https://github.com/thien94/orb_slam3_ros_wrapper) and [zang9/ORB_SLAM3_ROS2](https://github.com/zang09/ORB_SLAM3_ROS2)
